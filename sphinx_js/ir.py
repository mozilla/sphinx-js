"""Intermediate representation that JS and TypeScript are transformed to for
use by the rest of sphinx-js

This results from my former inability to review any but the most trivial
TypeScript PRs due to jsdoc's JSON output format being undocumented, often
surprising, and occasionally changing.

This IR is not intended to be a lossless representation of either jsdoc's or
typedoc's output. Nor is it meant to generalize to other uses like static
analysis. Ideally, it provides the minimum information necessary to render our
Sphinx templates about JS and TS entities. Any expansion or generalization of
the IR should be driven by needs of those templates and the (minimal) logic
around them. The complexity of doing otherwise has no payback.

I was conflicted about introducing an additional representation, since a
multiplicity of representations incurs conversion complexity costs at a
superlinear rate. However, I think it is essential complexity here. The
potentially simpler approach would have been to let the RST template vars
required by our handful of directives be the IR. However, we still would have
wanted to factor out formatting like the joining of types with "|" and the
unwrapping of comments, making another representation inevitable. Therefore,
let's at least have a well-documented one and one slightly more likely to
survive template changes.
